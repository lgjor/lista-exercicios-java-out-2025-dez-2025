# The first day of a month or not

We are used to talking about days in relation to their position in a month, for example, February 22. But as we've already mentioned, there's another way to address a day: to give an order number to each day in a year. Then we could say, for example, "53rd day of the year".

Write a program that reads a year and the order number of a day, and checks if this day is the first day of a month or not.

The program must output either "true" or "false".

## Sample Input 1:

2017 31
