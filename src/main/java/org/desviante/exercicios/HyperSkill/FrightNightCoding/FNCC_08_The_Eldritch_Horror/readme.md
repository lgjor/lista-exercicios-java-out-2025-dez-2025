# The Eldritch Horror

Even though you'd clearly inputted the phone number correctly, all you heard were long beeps. Nobody's home. How could it be? Your uncle was clearly expecting you today. Did he maybe fall asleep and just didn't hear the phone? You suddenly felt too exhausted to try any other number (although given the circumstances, calling the police didn't sound like a bad idea) and just sat on the nearest chair, desperate and miserable.

Maybe the owl-man had a spare tire somewhere in his enormous mansion? Well, he said he owes you, so maybe he even can walk you to the nearest gas station himself! As that last thought crossed your mind, the crackling overwhelming sound suddenly returned. You were ready for the blinding light this time and used a nearby dark bottle to see through it. The portal opened, and through it came something indescribable. Creatures of the impossible geometry: limbs that bent backward through dimensions, skin rippling like liquid obsidian, and eyes that blinked in fractal patterns. Their forms shimmered between states of matter, part mist, part flesh, part nightmare, leaving trails of cold light where they passed. You felt paralyzed with fear.

"Oh no. The guests have returned," whispered the owl-man. "I had the Old Gods here for a party right before I got caught in my timestream troubles. My friend, I think I will have to ask you one more favor... If we both want to get out of this room alive".

The masked man explained that the only thing the Old Gods fear is their true names being called out loud. However, it is tricky to find the true name. Apparently, each eldritch horror bestiary entry contain hundreds of words. But there is one and only one that does not have an anagram anywhere in the text. This word is the true name. You had to find it and do it fast! This was a task for your laptop and your programming skills.

You will receive a dataset containing many words, written in the Old Gods language, split by a whitespace. You will have to find one that does not have an anagram (meaning, you can't rearrange letters in the word to get another word in the dataset). That will be your answer.
